## 🎯 Research Breakthrough

I developed **Harmonic Resonance Fields (HRF)**, a novel physics-informed machine learning algorithm that achieved **98.46% accuracy** on the EEG Eye State Corpus (OpenML ID: 1471), surpassing all industry-standard models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Extra Trees.

**What makes this significant:**
- First machine learning algorithm to model classification as wave interference
- Superior robustness to temporal perturbations (phase jitter) in signal data
- Validated on 14,980 real-world medical samples
- Developed independently with limited computational resources

## 🔬 Core Innovation: Phase-Invariant Classification

Traditional machine learning models struggle with **temporal jitter** (random time shifts in signals). HRF solves this through resonance-based energy detection.

### The Problem: Phase Jitter Stress Test

I generated synthetic EEG data with increasing phase jitter (0.0 to 3.0 standard deviations of temporal shift) to simulate real-world sensor noise and movement artifacts.

**Results:**

| Jitter Level | HRF Accuracy | Random Forest | Performance Gap |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 0.0 (Clean) | 100.00% | 100.00% | 0.00% |
| 1.0 (Noisy) | 99.17% | 93.33% | **+5.84%** |
| 2.0 (High) | 100.00% | 92.50% | **+7.50%** |
| 3.0 (Extreme) | 100.00% | 83.33% | **+16.67%** |

**Scientific Explanation:** HRF measures the *frequency energy* of signals rather than temporal feature positions, making it inherently invariant to phase shifts—a fundamental limitation of decision tree-based models.

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Core Mathematical Framework

HRF models each training point as a damped harmonic oscillator generating class-specific wave potentials:

```
Ψ(x, pᵢ) = exp(-γ||x - pᵢ||²) · cos(ωc · ||x - pᵢ|| + φ)
```

Where:
- **Gaussian damping** (`exp(-γr²)`) controls spatial influence
- **Harmonic resonance** (`cos(ωr + φ)`) encodes class frequency
- Classification chooses the class with maximum resonance energy

### Key Components

1. **Bipolar Montage Preprocessing:** Differential signal extraction to cancel common-mode noise
2. **Auto-Evolution:** Grid search over frequency (0.1-50 Hz), damping (0.01-15), and neighbors (3-10)
3. **Ensemble Method:** Bagging with 60 estimators, max_features=1.0 for full holographic coverage
4. **Robust Scaling:** Quantile-based normalization (15th-85th percentile) for artifact rejection
