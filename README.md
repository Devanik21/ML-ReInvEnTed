A collection of custom, mathematically-derived machine learning inventions—including the Harmonic Resonance Field (HRF) spectral classifier—designed to challenge and expand upon traditional geometric and probabilistic learning paradigms.



# 🌊 Harmonic Resonance Fields (HRF): A Spectral Classification Algorithm

## 1. 💡 Conceptual Basis: Signals over Geometry
HRF rejects the traditional geometric view (distance, planes, trees) in favor of a **spectral physics model**.
* **Hypothesis:** Each training data point acts as a dampened oscillator, radiating a class-specific standing wave field into the feature space.
* **Classification:** A query point is classified by measuring the **Total Resonance Intensity** (constructive interference) of the waves from each class at its location.

## 2. ⚛️ Mathematical Formulation

### A. The Wave Potential Function ($\Psi$)
For a query point $x$ and a single training point $p_i$ belonging to class $C_k$, the wave potential is defined by a product of two terms: a **Damping Term** and an **Interference Term**.

$$
\Psi(x, p_i) = \underbrace{e^{-\gamma ||x - p_i||^2}}_{\text{Gaussian Damping Term}} \cdot \underbrace{\cos(\omega_k \cdot ||x - p_i||)}_{\text{Interference Term}}
$$

* $||x - p_i||$: Euclidean distance.
* $\gamma$ (Damping Factor): Controls the decay rate, ensuring noise from far-away points is *damped* (a key improvement over initial HRF v1.0).
* $\omega_k$ (Class Frequency): A unique frequency assigned to class $k$ to distinguish its wave pattern from other classes.

### B. Total Field Intensity ($I$)
By the principle of superposition, the total resonance intensity for a specific class $k$ at query point $x$ is the sum of all potentials generated by its members:

$$
I_k(x) = \sum_{p_j \in C_k} \Psi(x, p_j)
$$

### C. Decision Rule
The predicted class $\hat{y}$ is the class whose wave field produces the highest net positive intensity (strongest constructive interference):

$$
\hat{y} = \underset{k}{\text{argmax}} (I_k(x))
$$



## 3. 🛠️ Python Implementation Details (HRF v2.0)

The key code snippet implements the **Gaussian Damping** ($\exp(-\text{dist}^2)$) to ensure the model focuses on local, high-energy resonance fields, which significantly boosts accuracy on complex datasets like the `make_moons` benchmark.

| Parameter | Role in HRF | Analogue in Physics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`dists`** | Input to Damping and Cosine | Wave Propagation Medium |
| **`damping`** | Reduces influence of distant points | Attenuation / Frictional Loss |
| **`frequency` ($\omega_k$)| Class-specific multiplier | Natural Resonance Frequency |
